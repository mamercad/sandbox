* Write a web application in your language of choice that returns the current date/time in JSON
* Write a simple test application that will query this “API” X times per second and record success/failure/TTLB (Time to last byte)
* Perform a blue-green deploy with the method/technology of your choosing while the test application is running and demonstrate there were no failed requests
* Go from a single instance of v1 to a single instance of v2 gracefully
* The team suggests using the AWS Free Tier or GCP Free Tier to complete this task.
